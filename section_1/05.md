## Conceptual Aside
### Syntax Parsers, Execution Contexts and Lexical Environments

#### Syntax Parser:
> A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammar is valid. Going through code, character by character checking syntax.

#### Lexical Environments
> Where something sits physically in the code you write.<br>
> Lexical means having to do with words or grammar, it exists in programming languages in which where you write something is important. E.g A variable sitting inside a function

#### Execution Contexts
> A wrapper to help manage the code that is running<br>
> Can be a lot of lexical environments, which one is currently running is managed via execution contexts. Can contain things beyond what you've written in your code.
