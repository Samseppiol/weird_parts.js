var a = 3 + 4 * 5;
// Will return 23 because of basic mathematic rule that multiplication comes first
console.log(a)

// Because the equals operator is right to left Associativity.
var b = 2, c = 3, d = 4;
b = c = d;
// Which will make all these results 4
console.log(b)
console.log(c)
console.log(d)
