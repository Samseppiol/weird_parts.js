## Conceptual Aside
### By Value Vs By Reference

> Both cases talking about variables.

## By value 
> When a variable is set to another variable it is essentially the same but just has two separate spots within memory.

### By Reference 
> When a variable equal to an object, still gets a location within memory. But if the same thing is done, no copy is made, no new memory is made, it simply points to the same object.


### Mutate 
> Change something.

### Immutable 
> Means it can't be changed!
