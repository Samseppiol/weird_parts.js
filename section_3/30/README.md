## Functions Are Objects

#### First Class Functions 
> Everything you can do with other types you can do with functions.
> E.g assign to variables, pass them around, create on the fly

> Function resides in memory.
> All the features of a normal object
> Could attach a primitive(name value pair), an object, even another function.

> Functions don't have to have a name, can be 'anonymous'
